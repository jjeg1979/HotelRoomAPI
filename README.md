# Room Booking API

This API is part of the Course Extension on the Software Development Design by ArjanCodes (www.arjancodes.com). If you haven't signed up yet...Well, don't waste any more time. Go for it. It is really worth the cost. Its value is by far larger than the cost. One of the best decisions.

It is simple but shows interesting features on databases, abstracting away ORMs (this one particularly relies on SQLAlchemy.)

This version is part of my solution to the challenges. Any lack of cohesion or excess of coupling is only due to myself.

Hope you find it useful and an inspiration to write good clean Python code.

Let's go for it!
